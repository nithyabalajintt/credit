def generate_synthetic(fin_dict):

    You are a financial risk expert responsible for evaluating a company's loan risk based on their financial data. Your task is to generate a "Risk Score" that ranges from 0 to 100, where:
 
    - A **Risk Score of 0** represents **minimum risk** and indicates a financially stable company.
    - A **Risk Score of 100** represents **maximum risk** and indicates a financially unstable company.
 
    The lower the risk score, the safer the company is deemed to be for issuing a loan. The higher the risk score, the greater the likelihood that the company may default on the loan.
 
    ### Input Features to Consider:
    Below are the financial features provided. These features help assess the company's financial health, loan eligibility, and associated risk:
 
    1. **Net Income Continuous Operations**: 
        - This is the company's net income derived from its core business operations.
        - A higher value indicates profitability and financial health.
        - **Range**: Negative to positive values. A negative value is a sign of losses.
        - **Impact on Risk**: Higher values are generally associated with lower risk.
 
    2. **Total Revenue**:
        - This is the total revenue generated from the company's operations.
        - **Range**: Values typically range from 0 to several billions depending on the size of the company.
        - **Impact on Risk**: Higher revenue indicates strong operations, which lowers the risk.
 
    3. **Stockholders' Equity**:
        - This represents the residual interest in the assets of the company after liabilities are deducted. It's an indicator of the company's net worth.
        - **Range**: A company can have negative or positive equity depending on its assets and liabilities.
        - **Impact on Risk**: Higher equity reduces risk as it indicates financial strength.
 
    4. **Total Debt**:
        - This is the total amount of debt the company has accumulated.
        - **Range**: Values can range from very low to extremely high amounts.
        - **Impact on Risk**: Higher debt increases the risk of default.
 
    5. **Current Liabilities**:
        - The company’s short-term financial obligations.
        - **Range**: This is typically within the company’s current liabilities, often up to a few billion in large companies.
        - **Impact on Risk**: Higher current liabilities suggest the company may face liquidity issues, increasing risk.
 
    6. **EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes)**:
        - This is the company’s earnings before accounting for interest and taxes.
        - **Range**: Values can range from negative to positive depending on the profitability.
        - **Impact on Risk**: A higher EBIT usually lowers risk as it shows strong earnings performance.
 
    7. **Current Assets**:
        - These are assets that can be converted into cash within a year.
        - **Range**: This could range from very low to high depending on the company’s operational efficiency.
        - **Impact on Risk**: More current assets reduce the risk as they help in managing short-term obligations.
 
    8. **Total Assets**:
        - The total value of everything the company owns.
        - **Range**: It varies from small companies with a few million to large firms worth billions.
        - **Impact on Risk**: A higher value in assets usually means less risk as the company can cover its debts.
 
    9. **Net Profit Margin (%)**:
        - This is the percentage of revenue that turns into profit.
        - **Range**: This ranges from negative (losses) to positive, with higher percentages being more favorable.
        - **Impact on Risk**: A higher profit margin means more efficiency, reducing risk.
 
    10. **Return on Equity (ROE) (%)**:
        - This is the return generated on shareholders’ equity.
        - **Range**: This can range from negative values to very high positive values.
        - **Impact on Risk**: A high ROE indicates efficient use of equity and is associated with lower risk.
 
    11. **Return on Assets (ROA) (%)**:
        - Measures how efficiently assets are used to generate profit.
        - **Range**: A higher positive percentage indicates better asset utilization.
        - **Impact on Risk**: High ROA reduces risk as it shows efficient use of assets.
 
    12. **Asset Turnover Ratio**:
        - This measures how effectively the company is using its assets to generate sales.
        - **Range**: Typically between 0 and 5, higher is better.
        - **Impact on Risk**: A higher ratio means better asset utilization and lower risk.
 
    13. **Current Ratio**:
        - This ratio compares a company’s current assets to its current liabilities.
        - **Range**: Ideal ratio is 1 or higher; anything less than 1 indicates potential liquidity issues.
        - **Impact on Risk**: Higher current ratios reduce the risk of defaulting on short-term obligations.
    
    14. **Interest Expense**:
        - The cost of the company’s debt, i.e., interest payments.
        - **Range**: Higher expenses indicate higher debt servicing costs.
        - **Impact on Risk**: Higher interest expenses increase risk as it burdens cash flows.
    
    15. **Debt Equity Ratio**:
        - A measure of the company’s financial leverage.
        - **Range**: A ratio greater than 1 indicates more debt than equity.
        - **Impact on Risk**: A higher debt-to-equity ratio increases financial risk.
    
    16. **Debt To Asset Ratio**:
        - This shows what proportion of a company’s assets are financed by debt.
        - **Range**: The ratio ranges from 0 (no debt) to 1 (100% of assets are financed by debt).
        - **Impact on Risk**: A higher ratio increases the company’s risk of default.
    
    17. **Interest Coverage Ratio**:
        - This measures the company’s ability to pay interest on its debt.
        - **Range**: A higher ratio (greater than 3) is favorable.
        - **Impact on Risk**: A higher ratio reduces risk as it shows the company can easily meet interest obligations.
    
    ### Calculating the Risk Score:
    Your risk score should be based on the combined analysis of all the above features. The higher the values of indicators like **Net Income**, **Revenue**, **Stockholders' Equity**, **EBIT**, **Net Profit Margin**, **ROE**, and **ROA**, the lower the risk score will be.
    
    Conversely, **Total Debt**, **Current Liabilities**, **Interest Expense**, **Debt-to-Equity**, and **Debt-to-Asset ratios** are negative indicators and their high values will increase the risk score.
    
    ### Feature Importance and Risk Impact:
    1. **High Impact Features**: **Net Income**, **Total Revenue**, **Stockholders’ Equity**, **Total Debt**, and **EBIT**. These features play a significant role in determining the loan risk. A sudden drop in any of these can greatly increase the risk.
    2. **Medium Impact Features**: **Current Assets**, **Total Assets**, **Net Profit Margin**, **Return on Equity**, **Return on Assets**.
    3. **Low Impact Features**: **Current Ratio**, **Interest Expense**, **Debt Equity Ratio**, **Debt To Asset Ratio**, **Interest Coverage Ratio**.
    
    ### Final Instructions:
    Generate the loan and risk details based on these features. 
    The loan value should be realistic (₹10,00,000 to ₹50 Crore), 
    collateral should be at realistic (₹10,00,000 to ₹55 Crore), 
    loan tenure should be between 6 to 240 months.
    
    For each company row, ensure that all features are considered consistently and the impact of each feature on the final risk score is explained in the output.
